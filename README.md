# Battleship

This is a single-player game of [Battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)) built entirely with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, tested with Jest, and packed with Webpacker.

Based on my [previous project](https://github.com/1ba1/battleship), this new version introduces an enhanced AI that is smart enough to try adjacent slots after getting a hit.

Before starting the game, the player can take control over their grid by choosing between different semi-random combinations of ship placements. These are always non-adjacent in the spirit of fairness.

The updated UX now shows icons representing the status of the players' ships, either sunk or unsunk, throughout the game.

You can play it in the browser [here](https://gferrarocamus.github.io/battleship).
